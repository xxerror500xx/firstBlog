This is a no frills standard tutorial rails app nothing special to see with this one. I am merely following the directions from [Getting started with Rails]( http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). I have been implementing some ideas from the previous tutorial. [Learn Ruby on Rails: Book Two Daniel Kehoe](http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html). Stuff I will be implementing going forward with tutorials here on out are bellow.

  - [Github](github.com) obviously
  - [RVM](rvm.io)
  - [Heroku](heroku.com)
  - gem [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors)

Special focus on the following:
- Testing
- Structure
- and more to come...

## Ok, I lied about no frills Vanilla rails tutorial
I'm adding some gems to really dig into the tutorial. Inspired by [7-must-have-gems-to-install-on-any-project](http://www.rubyonrails365.com/7-must-have-gems-to-install-on-any-project/)
- gem "[awesome_print](https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print)"
- gem "[pry-rails](https://github.com/rweng/pry-rails)"
- gem "[quiet_assets](https://github.com/evrone/quiet_assets)"
- gem "[meta_request](https://github.com/dejan/rails_panel/tree/master/meta_request)" -- Works in conjunction with the Chrome rails_panel plug-in.

Still a couple more I want to try from that page but lets see how these work out first.
Kitchen sink here I come.

tut completed in 17 hours.
Awesome straight forward tutorial very helpful after [Learn Ruby on Rails: Book Two Daniel Kehoe](http://learn-rails.com/)
Next tutorial will be:
[Getting Started with Rails](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)
It looks like it will be mostly just practice of the previous two books.
