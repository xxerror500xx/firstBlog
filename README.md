This is a no frills standard tutorial rails app nothing special to see with this one. I am merely following the directions from [Getting started with Rails]( http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). I have been implementing some ideas from the previous tutorial. [Learn Ruby on Rails: Book Two Daniel Kehoe](http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html). Stuff I will be implementing going forward with tutorials here on out are bellow.

  - [Github](github.com) obviously
